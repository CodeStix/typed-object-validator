This library allows you to define typescript types and validators at the same time. It supports almost all complex typescript types including arrays, tuples, objects... and nesting them!

## Documentation

Everything is currently only documented using JSDoc, which shows up in your IDE when using this package. You can also take a look at the [example](https://github.com/CodeStix/typed-object-validator/example).

Real documentation is on the way.
